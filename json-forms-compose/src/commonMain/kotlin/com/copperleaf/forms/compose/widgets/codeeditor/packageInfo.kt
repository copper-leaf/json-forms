/**
 * Everything in this package has been copied from https://github.com/Qawaz/compose-code-editor, which is licensed under
 * the MIT license. There are no changes here other than the package name. That repo is only available via Github
 * Packages, which are not available publicly, and so it is not suitable to use as a direct Gradle dependency.
 * Hopefully, it will eventually be released as a library to MavenCentral so that I can remove the sources from this
 * repo.
